BBString is a quick and dirty string manipulation library for C. The library
is guaranteed to work with C99 and above.

    I. Limitations and design

This library is designed for quick and dirty usage for applications like games.
You can not use this library from multiple threads. This library has imprecise
parsing of floating-point numbers. Otherwise the library is optimized for
speed.

    II. Usage

In every translation unit where you wish to use the library, simply include
the header:

    #include <BBString.h>

And in EXACTLY ONE translation unit, you have to include the library together
while defining bbs_implementation, like this:

    #define bbs_implementation
    #include <BBString.h>
